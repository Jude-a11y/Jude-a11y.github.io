However, most studies on the relationship between CM and prosocial behavior focused on the overall experience of CM. Since different forms of CM exert various influences on adolescents, it is essential to find out which form of CM has the strongest link with prosocial behavior and the underlying mechanism behind it to fully understand this relationship and design a specific intervention for promoting prosocial behavior.Guided by internal working model theory and hopelessness theory, this study aimed to investigate the connections of multiple forms of CM with prosocial behavior, and explore the mediating mechanism of gratitude from the perspective of the broaden-and-build theory through a 14-day daily diary study.","tags":["Gratitude","Subjective Well-being"],"title":"Cognitive-affective structure of gratitude and its relationships with subjective well-being"},{"authors":["Linting Zhang","Ningzhe Zhu","Wenjie Li","Chengcheng Li","Feng Kong"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1678477413,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1679733537,"objectID":"4e5d6de34b690247112441baa0806c6b","permalink":"https://thomasgultzow.com/publication/GR_WB,pdf","publishdate":"2022-10-10T19:43:33.673Z","relpermalink":"/publication/GR_WB","section":"publication","summary":"Gratitude is considered to be a multidimensional construct consisting of both cognitive (cognitive appraisals of benefaction) and affective (feelings of gratitude) components, which is crucial for health and well-being. However, few studies have examined the cognitive-affective structure of gratitude and its associations with subjective well-being. Thus, the present study explored the two-dimensional structure of gratitude and its predictive effects on subjective well-being. Study 1 showed that the bi-factor structure of gratitude had the best fit with the data compared with the one- and two-factor models, and both general and affective gratitude positively predicted subjective well-being at the cross-sectional level. Study 2 further found that general gratitude positively predicted life satisfaction and positive affect after 3 months. However, cognitive gratitude negatively predicted subjective well-being at both cross-sectional and longitudinal levels. Therefore, future gratitude studies should consider the two-dimensional structure of gratitude.","tags":["Childhood experience","Subjective Well-being"],"title":"The relation between childhood maltreatment and hedonic and eudaimonic well-being in emerging adults: a daily diary study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chengcheng Li","Ningzhe Zhu","Linting Zhang","Wenjie Li","Feng Kong"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1670431929,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1679733140,"objectID":"9bd0b0f3ba9227e85b5827e184103808","permalink":"https://thomasgultzow.com/publication/CM_WB.pdf","publishdate":"2023-02-07T16:52:09.743Z","relpermalink":"/publication/CM_WB.pdf","section":"publication","summary":"Prior research has reported that childhood maltreatment is associated with poor well-being, but few studies have examined the association between childhood maltreatment and well-being including hedonic and eudaimonic well-being using a daily diary method.The present study investigated the association between childhood maltreatment and hedonic and eudaimonic well-being, and explored the mediating effects of social support and self-esteem.","tags":["Motivation","Subjective Well-being"],"title":"Pursuing Pleasure or Meaning: A Cross-Lagged Analysis of Happiness Motives and Well-being in Adolescents","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wenjie Li","Linting Zhang","Chengcheng Li","Ningzhe Zhu","Jingjing Zhao","Feng Kong"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1665514440,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1679732913,"objectID":"6bc1f55aceb2a11320f2a33f3821fa26","permalink":"https://thomasgultzow.com/publication/HM_WB.pdf","publishdate":"2022-10-11T18:54:00.695Z","relpermalink":"/publication/HM_WB.pdf","section":"publication","summary":"Hedonic and eudaimonic motives have been shown to have different effects on well-being, but most prior studies concentrated on hedonic well-being. To further verify the predictive associations between happiness motives (i.e., hedonic and eudaimonic motives) and well-being, especially eudaimonic well-being, we used a two-wave cross-lagged longitudinal design in a sample of 419 teenagers (mean age = 15.17 years, SD = 0.43 years) with an interval of eight months. The results showed that eudaimonic motives significantly predicted later hedonic and eudaimonic well-being, while only eudaimonic well-being, in turn, predicted later eudaimonic motives. There were no predictive associations between hedonic motives and two dimensions of well-being. After controlling the effects of age, gender, and subjective socioeconomic status, these results remained significant. Furthermore, after adding the lagged paths between two types of well-being, only eudaimonic well-being predicted eudaimonic motives, while eudaimonic motives could not predict hedonic and eudaimonic well-being.","tags":["Resilience","Subjective well-being"],"title":"Trait resilience and subjective well-being in emerging adulthood: a two-wave longitudinal study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Danlin Fan","Chengcheng Li","Ningzhe Zhu","Tianyi Wang","Feng Kong"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1665417831,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1679733475,"objectID":"00792fe83d2ab274d7a6d1c8d3cd8db6","permalink":"https://thomasgultzow.com/publication/RS.pdf","publishdate":"2022-09-10T16:03:51.121Z","relpermalink":"/publication/RS.pdf","section":"publication","summary":"Prior research has shown that trait resilience is linked with subjective well-being, however, less is revealed about the longitudinal relationship between trait resilience and subjective well-being in emerging adulthood. This study used a two-wave cross-lagged design ((N = 563 for Time 1; N = 509 for Time 2) to explore the relationship between these two variables in emerging adults. The cross-lagged path analysis found that trait resilience predicted the three components of subjective well-being (i.e., life satisfaction, positive affect and negative affect) over five months. Additionally, positive affect but not life satisfaction and negative affect predicted trait resilience over five months. The present study provides further evidence for the longitudinal relationship between trait resilience and subjective well-being in Chinese emerging adults. Limitations and future directions of the research were discussed."}]
